It was a city divided by a wall, in the middle of the nuclear crisis between the Soviet block and the US allies. \n\nThis is a story of pain, of heroes, of impossible escapes, of terror  and spies but also great solidarity. Let´s discover it together!\n\nWe will start our tour at Bernauer Strasse, an open air museum which separated family and friends overnight.\n \nWe will have a look at remains of the wall from a viewpoint before we visit the museum to have a look at some impressive photos and objects related to the escape of lots of people. \n\nOur walk continues to the Hauptbahnhof, once a ghost station, nowadays operating again. From here we will take the U-Bahn to the Tränenpalast. Until 1990, the departure hall built under East Germany’s SED regime was a border crossing from the German Democratic Republic (GDR) to West Berlin.\n\nBerliners soon dubbed this modern steel-and-glass construction, the scene of so many painful farewells, the “Palace of Tears”.\n\nHop on the U-bahn to head to  Checkpoint Charlie, our last stop. Checkpoint Charlie was the best-known border crossing between East and West Berlin during the Cold War. At the height of the Berlin Crisis in 1961 U.S. and Soviet tanks faced each other here.\n\nWant to see anything special? Let me know and I will make a personalized offer to fit you perfectly! ",
